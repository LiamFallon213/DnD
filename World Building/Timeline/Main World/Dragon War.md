[[The Eastern Continent]] seeing this began fortifying, 7 years after the beginning of the war, the feared invasion appeared. The [[Dragon Army]] never got as strong of a hold but was able to get most of the West Coast, with [[Aquagnae]] being the sole major city to stand west of [[The Great Sea]].
