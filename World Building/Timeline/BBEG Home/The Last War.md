Narration pre planning experiences of [[Julius Franklin]]

You wake up to hearng on the radio a warning that Russia has launched a nuclear torpedo in Cuba. 

Then a second warning of a nuclear exchange between the Soviet Union and the United States. 
 
 You run outside just to see multiple Minute Man ICBM's launching. You get in your car trying to drive to home to see your family one last time.
 
 As you go, radio stations go out one by one, Salt Lake, Casper, Rock springs. A long streak appears above, it splits into 3. You know to cover your eyes with your hands, then a second later you are drenched in a gluttonous amount of light. The Heat sears your skin, and you can smell it burning. Your cloths melt to your skin.
 
 Even with your hands covering your eyes, you can see the bones. The light goes down and you see three mushroom clouds rising over a burning city. You duck into a roadside trench just as the shockwave passes over you, covering your ears allows you to not go deaf. You pass out.
 
 As you snap out of the unconsciousness due to rain, you get up it feels like your clothes are fused to your skin. The rain is black.
 
 You are covered head to toe in severe burns.
 
 You get in your car, which luckily was just pushed into the same trench with very little damage. After a few minutes you enter the city. The smell is awful, like burned meat. the firestorm only extinguished by an incoming large storm, many large buildings still burning.
 
 You see people burned beyond recognition. You couldn't even tell their gender.  The fat had burned away.
 
 As you approach 3 the epicenter of a blast, you see blast shadows. Places where a person was vaporized by the initial heat wave and left a shadow of less burned area. You see thousands, men, women, and even young children. 
 
 You have a terrible headache and as you scratch it, the hair begins to fall out, and as you cough blood comes up. You recognize this as acute radiation poisoning. You finally feel your legs give out, and you collapse.
 
 You lay there, black rain falling on you. Lghtning flashes overhead. The world grows dark as you scream in pain, the adrenaline wearing off you feel everything.
 
 You cry and the world becomes nothing.
