Arothos is an ancient Aboleth. When he was young, he was trained to be the perfect tyrant, and the training worked. He at one point controlled a significant amount of the world, and only a massive natural event upset this. 

He was pushed back into the Sea of Fallen Stars where he waited for millenia before striking again.

He would then go on to use Chronoxilite to go back in time and raise himself, creating a paradox.
