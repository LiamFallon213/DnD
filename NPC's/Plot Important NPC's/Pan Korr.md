# Backstory
She is placed near the heart of the shadow fell, where the major negative energy is able to slowly bleed her dry of energy. She is kept there, unable to use her magic. Furthermore, she has weakened over the century to the point where if she was exposed to the full force of the heart of the plane, she would die.
