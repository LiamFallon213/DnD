# Backstory
## Pre shift
Julius was born in Cheyanne Wyoming on October 27th, 1942.  To Amaya Smith and Theodore Franklin. He grew up during the height of the cold war, terrified of nuclear war. Despite the best efforts, on his 20th birthday, a soviet submarine launched a nuclear torpedo during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

This started a nuclear war between the Soviets and the West. Julius watched the minute man missiles fly out of their silos from his house outside. He tried to get home but before he got there a nuclear weapon obliterated the city. He lived for weeks after the war, but died to radiation poisoning.

He was pulled into the new world, and decided to make it so that couldn't happen. Humanity needed a strong leader to prevent war from happening again. He would have peace, and it didn't matter how many had to die to achieve it.

## Post Shift
After the plane shift, Julius took a new name, Jupiter Asclepius. Jupiter being the king of the gods, and thenus from Athena, the roman god of Wisdom. He went on to build up his arcane abilities into one of the greatest on the planet. He build a magic shop, and became high council to the Arcanists guild.

However this wasn't enough for him to stop the war of 1313, so he decided to go further. He stepped into black, old magic. In doing so he found the power he so wanted, he commands the monster armies that siege the kingdoms of man. He then took a new name as his alius, The Black Mage.

Julius does not like killing or violence, it is often his last resort. However, he is willing to do anything he needs to do to accomplish his goal.
