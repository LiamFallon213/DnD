# Backstory
Atara was a slave when she was young on the [[Eastern Continent]]. Her master abused her, but when she was 13. She watched her mother die to her master, her powers ignited. She moved like lightning and used a branch and impaled her master. She fled the country and became a bounty hunter. Eventually after many years she ended up in Aquagnae.
