# Powers
Atara can manipulate time it's self. When she does, she can blink in and out of existence or even be in multiple places at the same time. However, she can't fully control the powers and is sometimes pulled through time.



# Backstory
Atara was a slave when she was young on the [[Eastern Continent]]. Her master abused her, but when she was 13. She watched her mother die to her master, her powers ignited. She moved like lightning and used a branch and impaled her master. She fled the country and became a bounty hunter. 

She joined the Legendary Heros, and fought in the [[Dragon War]]. Being the only native, and by far the most skilled with her powers she nearly defeated [[Julius Higeki]] when he turned on them.

Eventually after many years she ended up in Aquagnae.
