# Backstory
## Pre shift
Julius was born in 東京 （tokyo) on October 27th, 1942.  To Amaya Smith and Tanaka Higeki. He grew up during the height of the cold war, terrified of nuclear war.

When he was 15, his family moved to Cheyanne Wyoming.

Despite the best efforts, on his 20th birthday, a soviet submarine launched a nuclear torpedo during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

This started a nuclear war between the Soviets and the West. Julius watched the minute man missiles fly out of their silos from his house outside. He tried to get home but before he got there a nuclear weapon obliterated the city. 

[[The Last War]]

He was pulled into the new world, and decided to make it so that couldn't happen. Humanity needed a strong leader to prevent war from happening again. He would have peace, at any price.

## Post Shift
He went on to build up his arcane abilities into one of the greatest on the planet. He build a magic shop, and became high council to the Arcanists guild.

However this wasn't enough for him to stop the war of 1313, so he decided to go further. He stepped into black, old magic. In doing so he found the power he so wanted, he commands the monster armies that siege the kingdoms of man. He then took a new name as his alius, The Black Mage. 

Decades later in 90 ADW, Julius was on a research trip when he first encountered [[The Blight]]. This new infection shocked him.

He searched for information on new diseases and also discovered [[The Bloomplague]], and [[The Sporebloom]]. All on the western continent. He was able to find the sources of them, [[The Bloomplague]] was seeping in from the fey wild. [[The Sporebloom]] was seeping in from the shadowfell, and [[The Blight]] being the most dangerous was native to the Negative Plane, home to the [[Nightwraiths]].

Julius collected evidence of these plagues for 5 years, then presented them to the higher ups of many countries, including [[Dorn]], and [[Badowland]]. 

They did nothing, convincing Julius that the only way for them to defeat these great threats was to take power himself. He quickly forged records for himself in [[Aquagnae]] and became one of the leaders of the [[Aquagnae Arcanists Guild]].

He always wanted to know more magic, but now he needed it more then ever, he had to know what these diseases were. They couldn't be immediatly cured by divine magic trivially. Both [[The Sporebloom]] and [[The Bloomplague]] needed at least less

---

Julius does not like killing or violence, it is often his last resort. However, he is willing to do anything he needs to do to accomplish his goal.
