# Backstory
## Pre shift
Julius was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming on October 27th, 1942.  To Amaya Smith and Theodore Franklin. He grew up during the height of the cold war, terrified of nuclear war. Despite the best efforts, on his 20th birthday, a soviet submarine launched a nuclear torpedo during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

This started a nuclear war between the Soviets and the West. Julius watched the minute man missiles fly out of their silos from his house outside. He tried to get home but before he got there a nuclear weapon obliterated the city. He lived for weeks after the war, but died to radiation poisoning.

He was pulled into the new world, and decided to make it so that couldn't happen. Humanity needed a strong leader to prevent war from happening again. He would have peace, and it didn't matter how many had to die to achieve it.

## Post Shift
After the plane shift, Julius took a new name, Jupiter Asclepius. Jupiter being the king of the gods, and thenus from Athena, the roman god of Wisdom.
