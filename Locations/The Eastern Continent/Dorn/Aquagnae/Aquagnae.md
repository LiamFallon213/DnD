# Geography

Aquagnae lies at the head of the Kastnar river, where the Kastner River comes out of [[The Great Sea]] and plunges into the Valley. It lies between the two great falls, and uses the water for powering most of its city functions.

# Public Technology
Aquagnae has a unique power source, the pressure of the water from [[The Great Sea]] nearly 500 feet above, and the pull of the second great fall, which plunges the water another 700 feet below into the deep valley. The city uses the force of the water falling into specially made tunnels, which then flow at high speed through underground aquaducts benith the city. Most builldings use water wheels to take some of this immense power and use it to do basic mechanical functions. Due to it's location, the city lies on a slant of between 10 and 45 degrees. With the slant increasing on either ends of the city. The river it's self is rather rapid near the city. However, beneath the second fall, the water slows down greatly, and numerous lifts carry cargo up to [[The Great Sea]] above where it is shipped out to across [[The Eastern Continent]]
