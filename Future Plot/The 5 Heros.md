100 years ago there were 5 great heros brought by the goeds, [[Julius Franklin]], [[Atara]], [[Thran Avaernus]], [[Pan Korr]], and [[Sadami]]. They were tasked with defeating the [[Dragon Army]], which had been causing problems.

They were sucessful, but [[Julius Franklin]] then turned on his allies. Having seen the devistation of war twice now, he couldn't let this world die too.
