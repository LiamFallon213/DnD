100 years ago there were 5 great heros brought by the goeds, [[Julius Higeki]], [[Atara]], [[Thran Avaernus]], [[Pan Korr]], and [[Seisui]]. They were tasked with defeating the [[Dragon Army]], which had been causing problems.

They were successful, but [[Julius Higeki]] then turned on his allies. Having seen the devastation of war twice now, he couldn't let this world die too.

[[Julius Higeki|Julius]] decided that if the gods weren't going to protect this world, his experiments resulted in two entities, [[The Atropal]], and [[Abaddon]]

[[Julius Higeki|Julius]] was possessed  by [[Abaddon]]  who imprisoned the other 5 heroes.

[[Thran Avaernus]] is trapped deep in the underdark, in an arcane prison which uses illusion magic to keep him in a state of permanent mindless rage.

[[Pan Korr]] was imprisoned on the Shadowfell, she lies at the heart of darkness, where no light can exist. No plants can survive.  A dome of powerful arcane darkness a hundred miles across. Created by Wish, a side effect of this is the prolonged exposure to the dark energies of the shadowfell blinded her, so even if she escaped she could never see again.

[[Seisui]] was one of the more powerful ones, her and [[Julius Higeki]] fought long and hard in the deserted areas of the world. Eventually Julius won out and used a Wish to trap her inside the reflections. She can travel between them, but can't escape, or effect the world on a large scale.

She has a small religious following, worshiping her as The Lady of the Mirrors.

[[Atara]] knew to be ready, so she attacked [[Julius Higeki]], who was being possessed by [[Abaddon]], before he was ready. She nearly slayed him, but as she prepared the final blow, Julius used Wish to attempt to freeze her in time. However, the Wish went wrong, and shattered her across time instead. This also resulted in Julius's inability to use Wish.

They all had a symbol,
