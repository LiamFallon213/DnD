# BBEG

**Name:** TBD

The current idea is not to have some all powerful BBEG, but instead to have a very very smart BBEG. So a few likely races are:
- Human
- Litch
- Elf
- Fiend of some kind

Ideally he's just a commoner, or maybe a noble. Not a strong stat block, but his connections and political power keep him on top. Instead of manipulating through arcane or psionic means like Arothos, he instead manipulates the old fasion way.
