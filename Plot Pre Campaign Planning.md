# BBEG

**Name:** TBD

***
## Idea 1

The current idea is not to have some all powerful BBEG, but instead to have a very very smart BBEG. So a few likely races are:
- Human
- Litch
- Elf
- Fiend of some kind

Ideally he's just a commoner, or maybe a noble. Not a strong stat block, but his connections and political power keep him on top. Instead of manipulating through arcane or psionic means like Arothos, he instead manipulates the old fasion way.

## Idea 2

Lean into the meta aspect and go for some cliche like a demon lord. A [Balor](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#balor_mm,fbmt:sand~b1~b0) or the like could work quite well for this. Ideally it should be a hard fight at the end of the campaign ~ level 15.
