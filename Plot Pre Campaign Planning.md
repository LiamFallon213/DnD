# BBEG

## Idea 1

The current idea is not to have some all powerful BBEG, but instead to have a very very smart BBEG. So a few likely races are:
- Human
- Litch
- Elf
- Fiend of some kind

Ideally he's just a commoner, or maybe a noble. Not a strong stat block, but his connections and political power keep him on top. Instead of manipulating through arcane or psionic means like Arothos, he instead manipulates the old fasion way.


COULD BE ANOTHER META AWARE CHARACTER: Oh this ones good

## Idea 2

Lean into the meta aspect and go for some cliche like a demon lord. A [Balor](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#balor_mm,fbmt:sand~b1~b0) or the like could work quite well for this. Ideally it should be a hard fight at the end of the campaign ~ level 15.

## Idea 3

Have more of a Man V Nature story, where the party needs to fight against some event. [[The Scouring]] is a good option for this. In this case there is no clear BBEG but a number of objectives the party must complete.

*^ Might work better for a less continous story, like this is going for. Could also have some intresting global warming paralells.*
