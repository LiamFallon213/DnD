## Pacing
### Level 1-5: 
As this starts, [[the party]] is still entirely unknown, they are not the strongest hero by far, (normal heroes very highest ranks are ~10) and still have to go quite a way. They are at Copper in the [[Adventurers Guild]] rankings to start the arc, and will progress through the ranks to Diamond.
- Making a name for themselves
- Doing mainly routine quests
- Slowly moving up in the adventurers guild

### Levels 6 - 9: Arc 1 
By the beginning of this arc [[the party]] should be well known local heroes, each equivalent to at least 20 or so men. They are at Amethyst rank to start this arc.

### Levels 9-12: Arc 2


### Levels 12-15: Arc 3
