As this starts, [[the party]] is still entirely unknown, they are not the strongest hero by far, (normal heros very highest ranks are ~10) and still have to go quite a ways. They are at [[Copper]] in the [[Adventurers Guild]] rankings to start the arc, and will progress through the ranks to [[Diamond]].
- Making a name for themselves
- Doing mainly routiene quests
- Slowely moving up in the adventurers guild
