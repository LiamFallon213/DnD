# Description
A River Engine was a device used to move large ships upstream. It was made up of a water wheel connected to a winch, which used an arcanely reinforced rope to pull ships upstream.

River Engines resembled a small lighthouse with large water wheels. Each river engine could move between one and 5 ships. At up to 10 MPH.

## Danger

River engine ropes range in diameter from 1 in to 12 in. The largest River Engines could pull thousands of tons up stream.  However, under so much tension, if the line broke it could send the many ton wet rope flying at hundreds of miles per hour with as much force as a cannon. If unlucky, this could sink a ship by tearing a hole in it.
