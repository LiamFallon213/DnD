**World Tone:**  Silly with more serious moments. There will be a lot of in jokes and meta humor, but also serious moments.

**BBEG:** [[Julius Higeki]] 

**Unique things about the setting:** 
1. When the party dies they reset to the first moment of that week. ^eaec4f

2. If the party tries to tell anyone about [[Pre Campaign Setting Notes#^eaec4f| 1]] or [[Pre Campaign Setting Notes#^4b695c|3]] it goes horribly wrong. 
3. The [[Party]] is aware they are in a DnD game setting, so they can make meta comments on things. ^4b695c
