Kath was the name of a highly advanced arcane civilization which went extinct around 110,000 BDW. 

They were destroyed when [[The Blight]], [[The Sporebloom]], and [[The Bloomplague]]. Grew strong across the plane. These tore across the plane. Eventually, [[Kath]] decided to reboot the plane, a massive spell cured the entire plane; this was the last act of Kath, as after this the remnants of Kath dispersed.

The next thing that happened of note here were the actions of the breaking of the [[The 5 Heros]].
