# Part 1: The Edge of Infinity

The party has restarted [[Suprantir]], the ancient forges run hot. This is good, as Deterra is preparing for a siege.

  

The Abberants have pushed the Kingdoms of mortals back into their ancestral holdouts. Deterra is attempting to awaken the Tarrasque. The party must break the lines of the enemy, they must kill their general, Qedull, the Ultimate Tyrant. 

  

They sneak into their camp, into a cave seemingly newly made.

  

As they continue in, it seems unnaturally unguarded.

  

Inside Lapis hears a familiar voice. Kaleb (her lost lover).

They find him chained up in a cell, inside what looks to be a POW prison. (A good arcana or perception check tells them they went through a Gate into the Far Realm.)
  

They break Kaleb out (a commoner). He embraces Lapis, and as he’s about to say something, a green flash shoots out of the dark, and Petrifies Kaleb. Lapis feels him turn to stone in her arms rapidly, then a green flash as the statue is disintegrated. All that is left is a locket with Lapis’s face inside, and an inscription. I will see you again, my love. I’m sorry.

  

Qedull enters the room with backup. (FIGHT ENSUES)

  

When [[Qedull]] is defeated, the pocket dimension begins to collapse. When it does, [[Kaleb]]'s ashes are spread across the astral sea. He can not be resurrected.

  

They go to grab the [[Heart of Time]], when any of them touch it, the alternate realities section happens.

  

(Idea, separate them into the hallway for each person's session, isolate them, the active player is the only one there)

# Alternate Realities

## Alexander

Alexander wakes up in his class room (the one he blew up), he looks around and sees their faces. They seem concerned as they say he passed out. He sees Aaron is also not corrupted.

  

TLDR: His trauma never happened.

  

## Magnus

Magnus wakes up in his childhood home, surrounded by his family. His father Ulfgar and Mother Lessyl welcome him up, they ask about his work with his religious chapter. 

  

Notes: Town of Neverwinter, family blacksmithy The Hallowed Iron.

  

TLDR: the undead attack never happened.

## Kass

Kass wakes up in what looks to be a small hut in the Mushroom Biome somewhere. He rolls over and sees Lapis in bed with him. He gets up and sees Lily walking around the house, happy as can be.

  

TLDR: Best ending

When Kass breaks out of this, his sword will exault.

## Lapis

Lapis wakes up in another timeline, one where Kaleb never betrayed her and abandoned her.

  
  
  

When they emerge from the fake timelines the Heart rewards them by giving them knowledge of the real timeline

## The Lifting of the Curtains

  

When they take the gem, a Projection seems to appear. A fragment of the whole, a shard of infinity. Any chars that view it must make a save, as what they see is their lives, all possible permutations of choices they could have made, a fragment of time itself. 

  

### Lapis

  

Lapis see’s something, something horrible.

  

She sees her creation, on one side the Eldritch lady, and on the other, Arothos himself. The puppet master, setting in motion all that has happened. 

  

Arothos is Lapis’s final creator. He changed the blueprints from the rest of the slimekin to make her. She destabilized the first kingdoms of mortals, and then he gave her her sentience back, so he could make use of his ultimate weapon once more. However, Lapis met a young man.

  

This changed the course Arothos had preordained long ago, when he interfaced with the Heart of Time. In response, Arothos took it upon himself to break this and restore time, he slowly warped Kaleb, making him more paranoid. Until the breaking point.

  

### Magnus

  

Magnus see’s the other side of his encounter with the undead all those years ago, he sees an Illithid dominate them, Arothos wanted to make Magnus undead to prevent him from being able to become a Paladin.

  
  

### Alexander

  

Alexander sees his brother, he watches as Arothos slowly pulls on his mind without Aaron even knowing. Pulling Aaron towards the path that he thought would destroy Alexander.

  

### Kass

  

Kass sees as she is manipulated from early on in an attempt to get her to stay out of adventuring for good. He sees as Qedull is told not to kill him, but to kill those around him. He appears to have been supposed to be the doorholder to let Lapis in.

  
  
  

{Time until choices are made}

  

Arothos isn't just an Aboleth. He is his own creation, a paradox in itself. Raised by his own hand to be the perfect tyrant. A self contained monster.

# Part 2: Ocean of Infinity

  

The party is given information from Una that Deterra has located a magic item called “the heart of time”. It can seal something outside of time, in a single instant. It was produced in Suprantir to destroy the Dark Ones in the far past. But it resides in the most dangerous place on earth currently, at the bottom of The Sea of Fallen Stars. Where Arothos, the Emperor of Insanity resides.

  

They watch as Armageddon is released. He will be in Deterra by the end of the week.

  

They also learn the plan for Armageddon is that Arothos will release it to destroy Deterra and the rest of the plane, he will use the Heart of Time to power a device to keep it awake. Marvin and Una theorize if they can destroy the device, Armageddon will rest once again.

  

## The Heart of Time

-   A Magical Artifact that will put you in your ideal life, if you fall to it’s trap, your life will pass in a single instant and it will hold you in prison forever. If they don’t come out INSTANTLY they never will.
    

  

-   Chronoxilite is an attempt to recreate it.
    

  

-   It is the inverse of Arothos, a perfect anti paradox.
    

  

Arothos’s unblinking eyes see everything in the sea, they can see into your body, into your mind, into your soul. He has seen the past, and may even know the future. This is an enemy on a level never before encountered by the party. 

  

Arothos need not even notice you to warp your mind, his presence will project your fears onto your world. You must defeat these fears.

  

If you can make it that far you may be able to enter his lair, The Temple at the Edge of Infinity. It’s door is at the surface, but it goes down miles into the hard Basalt that lays at the bottom.

  

They must take the Heart to Arothos, who will absolutely be pulled into his perfect reality for all of time. He will be trapped inside the Heart, forever. His perfect prison.

  

As they go deep inside, the party will be FORCED to split, they will be able to communicate but not reunite. The split will be Lapis/Kass, Magnus/Alexander. Magnus and Alexander will be the ones in possession of the stone, Kass and Lapis will come face to face with AROTHOS, Lapis will instantly be charmed, and they will fight. Kass WILL die, the fight will be him VS Lapis & Arothos. He will not live. His body will be eaten by Lapis. However the distraction will work and Kass will not die, (then come back ideally). In vain.

  

Meanwhile while this is happening, Magnus and Alexander must fight in and get the Heart of Time in contact with Arothos.

  

If they are successful, when Arothos goes inside the stone, magical energy will be released. A diamond tear will fall out of the gem, a single casting of full “Wish”. No restrictions, nothing, pure power. 

  

(Ideally they resurrect Kass with it, if not, intervene with some Deus Ex Machina)

  

{Months pass, the world starts to heal, the characters are walking down the halls of Deterra, being hailed as heroes. } 

  

They are all given medals and thanked for their service. The emperor gives a speech about how the Emperor of Insanity has been destroyed. 

  

We gather here today to celebrate great heroes, and honor great sacrifices. Over the past year, the Aberrant War has raved the continent, and left so many dead. Friends, family, many will never be forgotten, some have no one left to remember them.

  

Yet, in the face of the worst crisis in our time, we came together, guided by the great heroes,

  

Magnus Aedugan: The hand of Kelemvor.

  

Alexander: The Highest Wizard

  

Kass: The Tyrant Slayer

  

Lapis: The Eternal

  

We must thank these heroes for their sacrifice, and their loss. We mourn the loss of Serrin. If only he could have lived to see the end of his own journey.

  

Now we must come together, as the effects of the war have only started to fade, but we can begin to heal. Only together can we survive in this new world, ravaged by war and death, it is now time for life and prosperity to return to these lands.
