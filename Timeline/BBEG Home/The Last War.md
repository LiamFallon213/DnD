Narration pre planning experiences of [[Julius Franklin]]

You wake up to hearng on the radio a warning that Russia has launched a nuclear torpedo in Cuba. 

Then a second warning of a nuclear exchange between the Soviet Union and the United States. 
 
 You run outside just to see multiple Minute Man ICBM's launching. You get in your car trying to drive to home to see your family one last time.
 
 As you go, radio stations go out one by one, Salt Lake, Casper, Rock springs. A long streak appears above, it splits into 3. You know to look away, then a second later you are drenched in a gluttonous amount of light. The Heat sears your skin, and you can smell it burning. Your cloths melt to your skin.
