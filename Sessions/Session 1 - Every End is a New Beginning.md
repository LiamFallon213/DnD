# Prologue

The session starts with each person describing how they die. Then they awaken in a room of brilliant white light, they are told they are being given a second chance and are plopped into the new world. They are on a ship, in what looks like a lake, but then they realize it is a river, they are on the [[Aquarius]] river. They get to see a river engine in action and have to save the ship as commoners. This gets them their first level.
